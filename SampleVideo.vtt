00:00:02.019 --> 00:00:03.250
What is happening is

1
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.460
we'll just go on the screenshot.

2
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.389
Uh,

3
00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:23.940
reset,

4
00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:24.200
see,

5
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.110
the reset year was successful.

6
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.440
Hm.

7
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.709
So when,

8
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.330
when we initially called the API during the first API call for the reset,

9
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.250
uh,

10
00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:45.169
what happens is,

11
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.889
uh,

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.500
the

13
00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:47.299
course,

14
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.049
uh,

15
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.299
the,

16
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.619
the course which we,

17
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.900
uh,

18
00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:50.549
the school which,

19
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.090
uh,

20
00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.880
we deleted,

21
00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:52.090
uh,

22
00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:53.259
where the course was assigned,

23
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.020
so that one doesn't get added.

24
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.400
But when we do this,

25
00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.619
uh,

26
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.860
do it a second time,

27
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.540
it is added properly.

28
00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:02.590
-- So that is the
-- issue.

29
00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.380
One minute,

30
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.860
one minute.

31
00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:04.220
So,

32
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.860
so what is the

33
00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:07.389
uh functionality here?

34
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.019
What should be the functionality here?

35
00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:13.680
Say you you have assigned the first you added the course

36
00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:14.769
to a

37
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.699
school,

38
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.940
then you reassociated the school to the course to

39
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.339
another school.

40
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.110
Both were created by the or added by the verifier.

41
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.160
So now you are

42
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.239
uh deleting the second school.

43
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.459
So after deletion of the second school when you are not resetting,

44
00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:37.370
so what will happen to the course?

45
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.239
Where will it get associated because the association is gone

46
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.019
now

47
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.540
for that course.

48
00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.959
So what will happen?

49
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.660
So the course in essentially gets deleted when we delete the school.

50
00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.489
But when we do a reset,

51
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.339
-- the idea is deleted
-- or the association gets deleted.

52
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.669
School uh the course also gets deleted.

53
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.940
So

54
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.940
with this example,

55
00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:05.190
I mean,

56
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.720
we can try with this one,

57
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.339
so

58
00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.779
I think.

59
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.800
Would it be like this or is a

60
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.419
um

61
00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:15.770
in a database,

62
00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.750
it is like this because the

63
00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.520
course isn't the course an independent entity,

64
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.619
uh,

65
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.889
independent of the school because you can reassociate to any school.

66
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.929
Yeah,

67
00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.270
but,

68
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.600
uh,

69
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.350
hm,

70
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.729
but,

71
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.580
uh,

72
00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:33.850
where will that course uh be assigned then?

73
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.729
-- In
-- the,

74
00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.679
in the course list shouldn't it be there?

75
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.350
Uh,

76
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.149
we can check that.

77
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.380
Uh,

78
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.259
we can try it.

79
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.580
Uh,

80
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.949
I'm,

81
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.169
uh,

82
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:45.479
I also got confused now.

83
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.960
Uh,

84
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.289
so,

85
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.729
uh,

86
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.850
your question is valid.

87
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.500
I,

88
00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:50.259
I just,

89
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.699
uh,

90
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.520
got confused.

91
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.419
I,

92
00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.059
what is the ID?

93
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.910
5773.

94
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.500
Hm

95
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.889
2024.

96
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.240
I'll select this one.

97
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.970
This is a test now.

98
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.559
And I

99
00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.710
Currently,

100
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.070
no schools are added by uh verified,

101
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.270
right?

102
00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:58.470
So I'll add one school.

103
00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:32.230
And uh so you are allocated 100% to this

104
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.269
project or you're working on other project also?

105
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.959
No,

106
00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:37.410
I have um the,

107
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.239
the allocation,

108
00:04:38.359 --> 00:04:39.100
but I don't know,

109
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.709
but

110
00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:44.709
uh I'm given some APT tasks from um Agus for schools also.

111
00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.549
Uh,

112
00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:49.549
I think 5656 tickets uh are there.

113
00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.399
OK,

114
00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.829
so you are switching based on the tickets.

115
00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:54.029
Yes.

116
00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:02.730
OK.

117
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.160
So we have these courses,

118
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.410
right?

119
00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:08.239
We'll select one of

120
00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:09.940
um course name computer.

121
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.160
We'll select this one.

122
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.869
Oh school,

123
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.769
Academy of Computer Technology.

124
00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:17.540
OK.

125
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.140
Do a reassociation with Alaska Bible.

126
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.799
OK.

127
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.079
I see.

128
00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:36.329
Now,

129
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.100
I need to go ahead and delete.

130
00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:40.980
Firstly,

131
00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:43.880
we'll check if that course was added to Alaska.

132
00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.640
Yeah.

133
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.950
We have it.

134
00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.570
Um,

135
00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:51.609
to go and delete Alaska Bible.

136
00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.380
OK.

137
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.869
OK.

138
00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.510
What happened to that course?

139
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.109
See,

140
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.890
the course uh also got deleted.

141
00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:10.540
There's no computer courses.

142
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.609
Now,

143
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.869
what I do,

144
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.760
what I'll do is I'll click on reset.

145
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.779
So yeah

146
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.709
Um

147
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.299
Yeah,

148
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.420
only the associated courses are there.

149
00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:25.529
So how,

150
00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:28.579
-- so every
-- day they do soft delete.

151
00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:30.850
Mm.

152
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.880
So now I'll uh call this reset

153
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.000
functionality.

154
00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:43.079
OK.

155
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.899
If you see,

156
00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:46.130
there was no computer course added,

157
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.320
right?

158
00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:47.839
In the response also you'll see.

159
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.089
Is it there?

160
00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.420
I don't see it.

161
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.709
This is the school name.

162
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.690
Uh,

163
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:03.529
this is a school name.

164
00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:04.079
That is fine.

165
00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:04.329
Uh,

166
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.359
we don't see that computer course here.

167
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:07.359
So

168
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.079
now I'll do a reset again.

169
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.149
See,

170
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.519
the course gets added now.

171
00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:18.260
So this is the issue.

172
00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:21.359
You can use this ID

173
00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:22.850
which is mentioned in the

174
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.170
Uh,

175
00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:24.910
take it

176
00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:27.149
and try to analyze why this is happening.

177
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.709
You got it,

178
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:27.989
right?

179
00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:29.420
So first time.

180
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.079
The course was not available,

181
00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.059
but

182
00:07:33.609 --> 00:07:34.450
2nd time.

183
00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:36.339
It is a

184
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.459
Can you please just uh reiterate the thing uh.

185
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.559
So,

186
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.089
uh,

187
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:46.549
uh,

188
00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.040
so you got the scenario,

189
00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:48.320
right?

190
00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:48.850
How,

191
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.239
how to reproduce this?

192
00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:50.559
Well,

193
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.910
so about the reset button.

194
00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:54.950
So what reset does is,

195
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.970
so there's a separate table

196
00:07:57.239 --> 00:07:58.399
from where it just,

197
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.029
uh,

198
00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.440
takes,

199
00:07:59.459 --> 00:07:59.920
uh,

200
00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:02.070
whatever the initial data was and

201
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.130
adds to our,

202
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.829
uh,

203
00:08:03.989 --> 00:08:04.709
uh,

204
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.829
I mean the mod uh database.

205
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.549
So that is what uh the reset functionality does.

206
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.049
But currently what is happening is when we click on reset.

207
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.410
And,

208
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.089
uh,

209
00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:15.929
try to,

210
00:08:15.989 --> 00:08:16.529
uh,

211
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.720
check like uh if the courses are reset properly.

212
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.709
So in for the first click,

213
00:08:21.859 --> 00:08:22.700
it is not happening,

214
00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:25.059
but for the second time it is happening.

215
00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:28.010
The reset is working properly for the second instance,

216
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.209
not for the 1st.

217
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:35.849
-- So that
-- is the we have to check the payload is going in the first reset and the reset

218
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:39.650
is fine.

219
00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:39.859
See,

220
00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:41.859
in the payload we just have application here,

221
00:08:42.058 --> 00:08:42.690
nothing much.

222
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:43.808
Oh,

223
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.770
OK.

224
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:45.830
See,

225
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.770
there's the IED an application here.

226
00:08:49.119 --> 00:08:49.530
So,

227
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.130
uh,

228
00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:50.770
basically,

229
00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:51.210
uh,

230
00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:54.099
just need to confirm what uh is different,

231
00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:55.530
uh different in

232
00:08:55.859 --> 00:08:57.409
both the request uh from.

233
00:08:58.169 --> 00:08:58.679
Uh

234
00:08:59.479 --> 00:08:59.799
Uh,

235
00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:01.719
you can just check the locks.

236
00:09:02.869 --> 00:09:07.929
So you'll find uh uh where exactly uh that particular lamb is.

237
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.039
I'm also not sure.

238
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.409
So you can just go through the code,

239
00:09:11.729 --> 00:09:14.650
try to check based on the uh API

240
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.419
uh based on this API coursework API,

241
00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:19.190
what exactly is going wrong.

242
00:09:20.119 --> 00:09:26.559
And then you can just add a comment in the ticket uh mentioning uh this can be the issue

243
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.770
or uh if you don't,

244
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.590
don't find it,

245
00:09:29.719 --> 00:09:32.549
just text me like whatever your observation is.

246
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:34.789
OK.

247
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.309
Got it,

248
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:36.719
right?

249
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.559
Mhm,

250
00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:38.030
yeah.

251
00:09:39.609 --> 00:09:40.330
OK then,

00:09:41.729 --> 00:09:42.400
